# Introduction

CAFF is a Conversion and Formatting Framework library for Java. It lets
developers specify text conversion and formatting code with annotations and a
simple API.

The conversion framework covers typical character-to-object conversions such
as primitives and date objects, and it allows creating customized rules using
annotations.

The formatting library focuses on several common text formats such as CSV,
fixed-length, and delimiter-based syntaxes.
